- Create phase noise histogram for losses and see if it fits Gaussian
- Need to find criteria for fragmentation of 2-species BEC
  See Penrose-Onsager fragmentation
- Test fragmentation in 1D
- Add master equation -> FPE chapter
- Add FPE -> SGPE chapter
- Add appendix on harmonic basis
- Add chapter on ground state (explain 0.5 particle per mode and so on)
- Update appendix on distributions for full 3D ellipsoid on a Bloch Sphere
  Need to find way to calculate squeezing along all directions
- Add theory for thermal modes
- Add description and results of noise tests (and implement them in the code)
