\chapter{Probabilistic representation of Bell inequalities violation}
\label{cha:bell-ineq}
% =============================================================================

In this final chapter we will diverge from the central topic of this thesis~--- the Wigner representation~--- and briefly discuss other quasiprobability representations.
In particular we will be interested in their ability to model such an inherent property of quantum systems as an entanglement~\cite{Einstein1935}, and a consequent violation of Bell inequalities~\cite{Bell1964}.
The possibility of this is often discarded because of the famous Feynman's lecture~\cite{Feynman1982}, where he posed a question \textit{``Can quantum systems be probabilistically simulated by a classical computer?''}, and his final answer was \textit{``If ... there's no hocus-pocus, the answer is certainly, No!''}.
His argument was based on the proof that Bell violations cannot be modeled probabilistically~\cite{Bell1964}.

However, it turns out that positive phase-space distributions of quantum optics~\cite{Husimi1940,Drummond1980,Hillery1984,Gardiner2004} are capable of such simulations, owing to extended codomains of the expressions corresponding to physical observables as compared to those considered by Bell.
Namely, observables in phase-space distributions can have a continuous range of values extending beyond the set of discrete expected values for the physical quantity, and, furthermore, their values can be complex~\cite{Reid1986}.
The expectations of such observables correspond to physical quantities only when integrated with the phase-space distribution as a weight.
This method of simulation is analogous to the weak measurement strategy, or \abbrev{povm} (positive operator valued measure)~\cite{Aharonov1988}, which has been experimentally demonstrated recently~\cite{Goggin2011}.
