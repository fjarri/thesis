\chapter{Multimode Wigner transformation}
\label{cha:mm-wigner}
% =============================================================================

Single-mode Wigner representation was introduced as early as 1932~\cite{Wigner1932} and later extended by Dirac~\cite{Dirac1945} and Moyal~\cite{Moyal1947}.
After that, it has been described in textbooks multiple times and widely used by researchers.
The detailed description of the single-mode Wigner function, analogous to the one provided in this thesis, was given by Moyal~\cite{Moyal1947} or, using a notation close to the one in this thesis, by later authors~\cite{Cahill1969,Hillery1984,Gardiner2004}.
Nevertheless, before diving into functional Wigner formalism, it is still advantageous to go through the derivation of the single-mode and multimode Wigner transformation first.
First, this chapter will help one familiarise with the notation used in the functional case.
Second, the proof structure used here will repeat itself in \charef{wigner}, and it is easier to grasp it on a simpler example.

This chapter will use Wirtinger calculus for differentials of complex-valued functions.
Details of this calculus are described in \appref{c-numbers}.
