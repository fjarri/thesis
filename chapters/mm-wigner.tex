\chapter{Multimode Wigner transformation}
\label{cha:mm-wigner}
% =============================================================================

The single-mode Wigner representation was introduced as early as 1932~\cite{Wigner1932} and later extended by Dirac~\cite{Dirac1945} and Moyal~\cite{Moyal1947}.
It has been described in textbooks multiple times and widely used by researchers.
A detailed description of the single-mode Wigner function, analogous to the one provided in this thesis, was given by Moyal~\cite{Moyal1947} or, using a notation close to the one in this thesis, by later authors~\cite{Cahill1969,Hillery1984,Gardiner2004}.
Nevertheless, before diving into the functional Wigner formalism, it is still advantageous to go through a derivation of the single-mode and multimode Wigner transformations.
Firsty, this chapter will help to familiarise the reader with the notation used in the functional case of the tranformation.
Secondly, the proof structure used here will repeat itself in \charef{wigner}, and it is grasped easier when applied to a simpler mathematical object.

This chapter will use the Wirtinger calculus for differentials of complex-valued functions.
Details of this calculus are described in \appref{c-numbers}.
