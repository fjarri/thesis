\chapter{Wrapped distributions}
\label{cha:appendix:distributions}


This chapter contains methods for finding properties of the wrapped distributions on a Bloch sphere.
\todo{Need to find papers about this, should be some standard way.
Or, at least, give clear definition of mean and variance for wrapped distributions.}

\section{One-dimensional distribution}
% =============================================================================

Suppose we have the set of angles $\phi_j$, and we want to find mean and standard deviation for this distribution,
keeping in mind that it is wrapped,
i.e. for any $j$ we can replace $\phi_j$ by $\phi_j + 2\pi n$, leaving the distribution parameters intact.

There is an approximate method, which works well if the distribution has a distinguished maximum.
First, map the angles to the unit circle in the complex plane:
\[
	p_j = e^{i\phi_j}.
\]
Now if we take the mean value
\[
	p_{mean} = \langle p_j \rangle,
\]
it will be located close to the part of the circle where points are more clustered.
Then, normalisation
\[
	\tilde{p}_{mean} = p_{mean} / | p_{mean} |
\]
gives us a unit vector pointing to approximate maximum of the distribution.
Returning back to angles,
\[
	\phi_{mean} = arg(\tilde{p}_{mean}).
\]
