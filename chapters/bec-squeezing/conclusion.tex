In this chapter we have seen that the truncated Wigner approach can be successfully used to obtain correlations of the higher orders from the simulations without changing said simulations themselves, but only by processing the raw results.
Nonlinear elastic and inelastic interactions, along with various sources of technical noise can be added to the model straightforwardly, without affecting the measurement of the required correlations.
The simulations described in this chapter predict the degree of quantum noise-reduction, which is a technique that can be used to improve precision quantum interferometry.
The quantum noise is initially reduced due to stretching and rotation of the quantum noise ellipsoid (see~\figref{bec-squeezing:separation:cloud}), similar to that found in quantum soliton squeezing~\cite{Carter1987,Drummond1993a}.
Importantly, these quantum squeezing calculations indicate conditions that will allow this macroscopic quantum effect to be experimentally observed in ultra-cold atomic \abbrev{bec} for much larger atom numbers than calculated previously.
