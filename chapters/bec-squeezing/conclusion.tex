In this chapter we have seen that the truncated Wigner approach can be successfully used to obtain correlations of the higher orders from the simulations without changing said simulations themselves, but only by processing the raw results.
Nonlinear elastic and inelastic interactions, along with various sources of technical noise can be added to the model straightforwardly, without affecting the measurement of the required correlations.
The Wigner method provides a solid framework for describing \abbrev{bec} interferometry experiments in cases when the density of a \abbrev{bec} stays high enough to satisfy the applicability condition~\eqnref{wigner-bec:truncation:delta-condition} (which is very often the case).
