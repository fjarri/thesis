Nondimensionalization can be performed in many ways;
the parameters of the harmonic trap are the natural choice for the new units.
Taking into account the usual symmetry $\omega_x = \omega_y = \omega_\rho$ which exists in experiments,
we can set the following units for length, time and energy:
\[
	l_\rho = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{m\omega_\rho}},\,
	t_\rho = \frac{1}{\omega_\rho},\,
	E_\rho = \hbar \omega_\rho.
\]

Wave function can be made dimensionless differently depending on the normalisation.
We will use the transformation
\[
	\psi = \psi^\prime l_\rho^\frac{3}{2},
\]
that keeps the integral of wave function over space equal to number of particles in the system:
\[
	\int\limits_V \psi dV = \int\limits_V \psi^\prime dV^\prime = N,
\]
where the variables with primes are dimensionless.
