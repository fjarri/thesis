\copypaste{We also perform mesoscopic Schr\"odinger cat state simulations, corresponding to recent ion-trap experiments with $M$ qubits.
These states violate a genuine multipartite Bell inequality, which means that it is impossible to confine the Bell violation to a microscopic part of the state.
Such inequalities require the measurement of all possible correlation functions at the highest order available.
We find two distinct scaling laws for the total computational difficulty, as measured by the number of samples required to obtain a given sampling error.}
