% =============================================================================

As we have seen in the previous chapters, the truncated Wigner method provides noticeable corrections to such important experimental observables as visibility or phase noise.
While they do establish the theoretical limits for these quantities, real measurements are still mostly limited by technical noises, which do not require quasiprobability methods to be accounted for.

In this chapter we will consider a property of \abbrev{bec} interferometry experiments which cannot be obtained from the mean-field model.
This property is the degree of spin squeezing, which stands for the minimum uncertainty of the collective spin of a two-component \abbrev{bec}.
A state with a high degree of coherence between the two components, such as the one produced by a beam-splitter has equal uncertainty in any direction.
Further evolution and nonlinear interactions can redistribute it, making it possible to achieve the uncertainty lower than the shot noise in some direction (at the price of the increased uncertainty in other directions, to preserve the Heisenberg inequality).
Spin squeezing was theoretically introduced by Kitagawa and Ueda~\cite{Kitagawa1993}, and by Wineland \textit{et~al}~\cite{Wineland1994}, and later observed experimentally~\cite{Hald1999,Kuzmich2000}.
It allows the analysis of interferometry experiments beyond the usual shot noise limit~\cite{Riedel2010,Gross2010} and can serve as a measure of entanglement in a two-component \abbrev{bec}~\cite{Sorensen2001}.

In this chapter we will derive an expression that will allow us to obtain the degree of squeezing from the moments of the wavefunctions in the truncated Wigner approach, and apply it to a recent spin squeezing experiment.
We will also consider another possible experiment with \abbrev{bec} near a Feshbach resonance where spin squeezing can be observed and discuss the complications caused by nonlinear losses.
