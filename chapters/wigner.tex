% =============================================================================

While single-mode and multi-mode Wigner transformations proved to be quite useful in a multitude of applications, in multidimensional cases with nonlinear evolution and losses it is much more convenient to operate on a higher level, using field operators and wave functions.
Of course, it is possible to use single-mode creation and annihilation operators exclusively,
but similarly to how vectors and matrices encapsulate summations and facilitate operations with sets of values, functional calculus simplifies multi-mode master equations and corresponding differential equations.
