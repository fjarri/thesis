\chapter{Functional Wigner transformation}
\label{cha:wigner}
% =============================================================================

While single-mode and multimode Wigner transformations proved to be quite useful in a multitude of applications, in multidimensional cases with nonlinear evolution and losses it is much more convenient to operate on a higher level, using field operators and wave functions.
Of course, it is possible to use single-mode creation and annihilation operators exclusively, but similarly to how vectors and matrices encapsulate summations and facilitate operations with sets of values, the field operator calculus simplifies multimode master equations and corresponding differential equations.

The main thrust of this chapter is to introduce mappings that allow one to replace non-commuting field operators by classical fields for computational purposes in later chapters.
