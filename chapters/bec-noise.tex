\chapter{Quantum noise in BEC interferometry}
\label{cha:bec-noise}
% =============================================================================

BECs are macroscopic quantum objects and can be potentially used as high precision interferometric detectors and sensors.
Unlike photons, atoms can interact strongly, leading to loss of coherence and decreased interferometric contrast.
An accurate quantitative model for these quantum many-body effects is essential for explaining the results of atom interferometry experiments and for planning the future ones.

In this chapter we will apply the truncated Wigner method from \charef{wigner-bec} to the task of simulating the dynamics of such experiments.
We will start from describing the mean-field approach leading to the conventional Gross-Pitaevskii equations~\cite{Pitaevskii2003} (\abbrev{gpe}s).
We then extend it to include quantum effects, such as the noise from linear and nonlinear losses.
The accurate description of nonlinear losses is especially important as their relative effect increases when atom numbers are increased to improve contrast.

We will compare the effect of quantum fluctuations and technical noises, such as imperfect measurements or coupling phase and amplitude uncertainty, on the interferometric contrast.
We will also consider the experimental measurement process of the contrast in detail and investigate the influence of quantum effects on such an important characteristic as phase noise.
