\section{Wigner transformation}
% =============================================================================


\copypaste{
We start by assuming that the BEC has $s$-wave interactions, together with Markovian losses due to $n$-body collisions.
We employ a master equation together with the Wigner-Moyal quantum phase-space representation~\cite{Gardiner2004} and a truncation of third- and higher-order derivatives in the equations of motion.
If we regard the commonly used Gross-Pitaevskii equation as a classical, first approximation to mean-field condensate dynamics, the truncated Wigner approach is best thought of as the second term in an expansion in inverse particle number.

\todo{
This section should be mostly dedicated to results in \cite{Egorov2011} and \cite{Opanchuk2012} (and possibly \cite{Egorov2013}).
