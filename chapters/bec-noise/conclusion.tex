The examples in this chapter demonsrate that the truncated Wigner approach gives correct long-time predictions of quantum effects for the system comprised of large number of atoms.
Both of these features, large atom numbers and long time-scales, are essential to accurate interferometric measurements.
The predictions remains correct even despite multimode dynamical motion in three dimensions and substantial losses of most of the condensate atoms.
On longer time-scales, the experimental accuracy is limited by technical noises, and we have no data for comparisons.
