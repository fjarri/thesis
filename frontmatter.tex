% An abstract of not more than 400 words should be bound into each copy of the examinable outcome. The abstract should indicate the problem investigated, the procedures followed, the general result obtained and the major conclusions reached. It should not contain any illustrative material or tables.

A method of simulating the full quantum field dynamics of multimode multi-component Bose-Einstein condensates is developed.
The truncated Wigner representation is used to obtain a probabilistic theory.
The representation is extended to to use a functional calculus and can be applied to quantum fields in the arbitrary number of dimensions.
Detailed proofs of the corresponding theorems are given.

This method produces c-number stochastic equations which may be solved using conventional stochastic integration methods.
The technique is valid for large mode occupation numbers.
It describes spatial evolution of spinor components and properly accounts for nonlinear interactions and losses.
The method is further used to model several experiments where quantum effects are significant, and untangible for simpler approximations.
It is shown to describe leading quantum corrections correctly for effects such as phase noise, quantum squeezing, entanglement, EPR correlations, and interactions with engineered nonlinear reservoirs.

In conclusion, the functional Wigner representation framework developed in this thesis provides a relatively fast and accurate method of simulating dynamics of large nonlinear quantum systems, such as trapped Bose-Einstein condensates.
The methods of solving the resulting stochastic equations are easily parrallelisable and scalable, and can be implemented effectively on modern hardware.
